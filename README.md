1. Organization Overview
Name: KEM Arts
KEM Arts is an independent art business that began by displaying pieces in local coffee shops, exhibiting occasionally, and using Instagram as its main online space. While this has helped build a small following, the lack of a professional website limits growth. A dedicated site will act as a central hub, showcasing the artist’s portfolio, supporting sales, and strengthening the brand’s identity.
Mission and Vision:
The mission is to create meaningful and accessible art that connects with a broad audience. The vision is to expand into a professional online presence, positioning KEM Arts as a recognized brand that can reach audiences beyond social media and local exhibitions.
Target Audience:
The target audience includes young professionals, collectors, and art enthusiasts aged 18–40 who value creative, personalized artwork and often engage with cultural spaces like coffee shops and exhibitions.
2. Website Goals and Objectives
The website will provide a professional space for growth.
•	Build a central hub for all exhibitions, updates, and artwork, reducing reliance on Instagram.
•	Provide an online store where prints and originals can be purchased securely.
•	Create a professional portfolio to attract gallery opportunities and collaborations.
•	Establish a mailing list to keep audiences engaged with exhibitions and new collections.
3. Current Website Analysis
Currently, KEM Arts relies only on Instagram. While it provides strong visuals and good engagement, it lacks e-commerce tools, structured portfolios, and professional presentation. A website will build on this foundation by adding sales functionality and a polished image.

•	Homepage with featured and recent artwork and links to collections.
•	About Page with an artist biography.

•	Newsletter subscription for regular updates.
5. Design and User Experience
The design will highlight the art while keeping usability simple.
•	Color Scheme: Neutral backgrounds with accents from the artwork.
•	Typography: Modern sans-serif (Aptos) for readability and structure.
•	Layout: Grid-based, minimalist, and image-focused.
•	UX: Mobile optimization, quick loading, and a smooth checkout process.
6. Technical Requirements
The site will require reliable hosting (e.g., Bluehost), a domain name such as kemarts.com, and development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. WordPress or Shopify will be used for content management and e-commerce.
7. Timeline and Milestones
