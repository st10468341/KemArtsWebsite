KEM Arts Website
Project Overview

KEM Arts is an independent art business founded by Kyle-Ethan Meiring. The brand began by showcasing artworks in local coffee shops, occasional exhibitions, and primarily using Instagram for online presence. While effective for engagement, the absence of a professional website limits growth and sales opportunities. This project aims to build a professional, responsive website to showcase KEM Arts’ portfolio, support sales, and strengthen the brand identity.

The website emphasizes accessibility, visual appeal, and usability, acting as a central hub for exhibitions, collections, and direct customer engagement.

Mission and Vision

Mission: To create meaningful, high-quality, and accessible artwork that resonates with a broad audience.

Vision: To expand KEM Arts into a professional online presence, positioning the brand as recognized and credible beyond social media and local exhibitions.

Target Audience

Young professionals, collectors, and art enthusiasts aged 18–40.

Individuals who value personalized, creative artwork.

People who engage with cultural spaces such as coffee shops, pop-up exhibitions, and online art communities.

Website Goals

The website is designed to:

Provide a central hub for exhibitions, updates, and artwork, reducing reliance on Instagram.

Offer a secure online store for prints and original artworks.

Showcase a professional portfolio to attract gallery opportunities and collaborations.

Establish a mailing list to keep audiences engaged with exhibitions, new collections, and promotions.

Current Website Analysis
